<meta name="description" content="Question My Answer Correct Answer Explanation 2 - Which of the following has the greatest potential for compromising a user’s personal privacy? The user’s public key used for encryption A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser A public key is designed to be shared to allow for data transfer. 5 - Of the following potential benefits, which is LEAST likely to be provided by the upgraded system?. Customers are likely to spend less time listening to information not relevant to their issue. The company will be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call. Time is no longer wasted due to the phone listing common fixes. 7 - To direct a call to the appropriate destination, which of the following input data is needed by the upgraded system that was NOT needed by the original system? 1-Audio signal of the customer’s voice, 2-The customer’s keypad selection, 3-The customer’s phone number II only I only The previous system did not require the user to speak their issue into the phone. 28 - Which of the following code segments can be used to assign the intended string to newString ? A&amp;D A&amp;C D only displays the removed letters, and doesnt display the remaining letters. 29 - What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment? true false true false false false I completely missed the NOT statment in the code. 48 - Which of the following is a benefit of using a simulation instead of an experiment to make a prediction? A&amp;C A&amp;B Simulation results are not always the same every time it is run. 49 - A city planner is using simulation software to study crowd flow out of a large arena after an event has ended. The arena is located in an urban city. Which of the following best describes a limitation of using a simulation for this purpose? Running a simulation requires more time to generate data from trials than observing the crowd exiting the arena at various events. The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement. Simulations are fast and can be used for rapid development. 50 - Based on the values in the table, which of the algorithms appear to run in reasonable time?
