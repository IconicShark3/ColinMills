<h2 id="q8---laptops-being-borrowed-from-a-school-library">Q8 - Laptops being borrowed from a school library</h2>

<p>Mistake: Only selected one option on the two-select question</p>

<h2 id="q13----old-enough-to-drive-but-not-to-vote">Q13  - old enough to drive but not to vote</h2>

<p>Mistake: Option I does not work because it incorrectly handles 18 year olds. It lets 18 year olds through while the explanation states that they need to be under 18.</p>

<h2 id="q22---find-average-height-of-students">Q22 - Find average height of students</h2>

<p>Mistake: I included the chance of error by passing data between many hands when I should have expected an error free enviroment.</p>

<h2 id="q41---simulating-election-votes">Q41 - Simulating election votes</h2>

<p>Mistake:  Only selected one option on the two-select question. D would have been an equal answer as is looks for &lt; 2/10</p>

<h2 id="q50-ascii-character-with-hexidecimal">Q50 ASCII character with hexidecimal</h2>

<p>Mistake: This question is genuiney hard and I definitely need to study hexidecimal systems more.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I believe that I could have done better had I studied or payed more attention to the blantantly stated expectations on some of the questions. I definitely need to take another look at hexidecimal and refresh my memory.</p>
