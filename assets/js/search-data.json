            "content": "Q 1 . Incorrect Answer: 70 Seconds Correct Answer: 80 Seconds Explanation: I did not correctly read that each process can only be ran on one processor at a time. Thus I simply summed the values and divided by two instead of finding the smallest combination of two process that can execute in more time than a third process. . Q 11 . Incorrect Answer: B Correct Answer: A Explanation: I misread option A and believed that no listed process followed the path of Combine -&gt; Sort -&gt; Remove Duplicates. . Q 12 . Incorrect Answer: D Correct Answer: B Explanation: I did not take into account the extra space that would be needed to store a larger data set. I also imagined that more code statments would lead to a larger performance impact. . Q 37 . Incorrect Answer: D Correct Answer: B Explanation: I forgot that n^2 is considered a reasonable execution count given that some code runs at n! executions. . Q 41 . Incorrect Answer: A Correct Answer: C Explanation: It is more useful to know which row a negative is than knowing that there is a negative in a column. . Q 43 . Incorrect Answer: A Correct Answer: B Explanation: Procedural abstraction makes code easier to read at the expense of a small amount of processing time due to the creation of functions. . Q 47 . Incorrect Answer: A Correct Answer: B Explanation: I made a simple miscalculation that led me to believe that 15 would have been much too far from the highest indexed value, which would have made 10 technically the closet answer. . Q 49 . Incorrect Answer: B Correct Answer: A Explanation: This code segment traverses the entire list and compares all elements in the list to the first element. This includes comparing the first element to itself which will always evaluate to true; however, the first element in the list does not represent a student’s score. . Q 50 . Incorrect Answer: D Correct Answer: B Explanation: Algorithm III does not work correctly. Algorithm III chooses the person(s) with the earliest day, disregarding the month. For example, algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5. .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # Every value only appears once / no duplicates # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # This set only prints one of each value in the same way that hashtables can only have 1 of each key. . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(&quot;sweet home&quot;,ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . -IMAGE L- . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . -IMAGE L- . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(41)) . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets #print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

What is before and after on pixels in three images? scaling an image reduces the amount of pixels in the photo, reducing its size. This allows it to load faster at the cost of image quality. | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Yes, scaling an image is a form of lossy compression because it is very noticable. As you can see I made a few edits to the program that displays a blurry low resolution image at a large size. | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image1(img): baseWidth = 100 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def scale_image2(img): baseWidth = 250 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) def scale_image3(img): baseWidth = 500 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image3(scale_image2(scale_image1(img))) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (500, 500) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (500, 364) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (500, 374) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

In my project this trimester, I will have a feature where users can input their own data into the system, allowing the platform to evolve without developer assistance. Users will be able to add their own ingredients to my measurement converter as the main CREATE function of my CRUD system. . 5.5 . Creative Commons universal: . Full public domain, everything is completely free to use. . MIT: . Free use of code but able to publish closed versions that are not freely usable. . GPL: . Free use of code but no ability to release closed versions. . Our Project . I would use the MIT Licence because it allows the use of code freely and the making and distributing closed source versions.s . 5.6 .

View/Blog Concepts . A notes/blog would be created to add Notes between students and teacher, part of original concept. Notes could be used for many types of applications.

Build and correlate a technical design between frontend view and backend model. This blog is focussing on frontend view., and visual concepts on how CRUD operations are presented to user of system. This particular Jupyter Notebook and code within it are used to help establish technical ideas. Start a design for your project... . Each project must have a View (as pictured) and Model (json data is fetched into the View). Describe your project. | Describe your View. Use Markdown, HTML, UML, other visuals, tables are used to characterize a project. This shows the Teacher and Graders understanding of planning Model and View. | Transition from pure design and start inserting code elements, like inputs. Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple ... This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit. Student(s) could assist in rework of my Flask project from last year into a Frontend / Backend solution.

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about Functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single fucntion from the package. We can do that with the word from, followed by the package name, then the word import, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use blank. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word __, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from time import time as clockyboi start = clockyboi() end = clockyboi() print(end-start) . 6.222724914550781e-05 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python package library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | __ | . ?? | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | __ | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | __ | .

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 35775 def convertToBinary(n): thelist = [] while n &gt; 0: if n % 2 == 0: thelist.append(0) n = n / 2 else: thelist.append(1) n = n / 2 n = n - 0.5 x = len(thelist) - 1 final = str(thelist[x]) x = x - 1 while x &gt;= 0: final = final + str(thelist[x]) x = x - 1 print(final) convertToBinary(decimal) . 1000101110111111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . values = [2,5,3,6,86,253,4325,78,53,69,23,4142,56373,420] def findextrema(set): min = 0 max = 0 if set[0] &gt; set[1]: max = set[0] else: min = set[0] for i in range(len(set)): if set[i] &gt; max: max = set[i] elif set[i] &lt; min: max = set[i] return[min,max] stuff = findextrema(values) print(&#39;min is&#39;,stuff[0],&#39;- max is&#39;,stuff[1]) . min is 2 - max is 56373 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def BinaryS2L(binary): if type(binary) == str: out = [] i = len(binary) - 1 while i &gt;= 0: out.append(int(binary[i])) i = i - 1 out.append(0) return(out) elif type(binary) == list: out = &#39;&#39; for i in range(len(binary)): out = str(binary[i]) + out return(out) def BinaryAdder(x,y): one = BinaryS2L(x) print(one) two = BinaryS2L(y) print(two) temp = 0 end = [] rng = len(x) + 1 for i in range(rng): if one[i] + two[i] + temp == 0: temp = 0 end.append(0) elif one[i] + two[i] + temp == 1: temp = 0 end.append(1) elif one[i] + two[i] + temp == 2: temp = 1 end.append(0) elif one[i] + two[i] + temp == 3: temp = 1 end.append(1) return(BinaryS2L(end)) a = str(input(&#39;What is the first of the two numbers would you like to add? Please be sure that both values are the same binary length.&#39;)) b = str(input(&#39;What is the second of the two numbers would you like to add? Please be sure that both values are the same binary length.&#39;)) print(BinaryAdder(a,b)) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . [0, 1, 0, 0] [1, 0, 1, 0] 0111 .",

Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example .

Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs .

As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 .

To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. .

Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 4): print(sum,counter) sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 0 1 1 3 4 5 9 7 16 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 .",

RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace. Developers use Rapid API to discover and connect to thousands of APIs. &quot;&quot;&quot; url = &quot;https://corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com/api&quot; headers = { &#39;x-rapidapi-key&#39;: &quot;dec069b877msh0d9d0827664078cp1a18fajsn2afac35ae063&quot;, &#39;x-rapidapi-host&#39;: &quot;corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } # Request Covid Data response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) print(response.json) # uncomment this line to see raw data # This code looks for &quot;world data&quot; print(&quot;World Totals&quot;) world = response.json().get(&#39;world_total&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;world_total&quot; for key, value in world.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) print() # This code looks for USA in &quot;countries_stats&quot; print(&quot;Country Totals&quot;) countries = response.json().get(&#39;countries_stat&#39;) for country in countries: # countries is a list if country[&quot;country_name&quot;] == &quot;USA&quot;: # this filters for USA for key, value in country.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) . &lt;bound method Response.json of &lt;Response [200]&gt;&gt; World Totals total_cases 509,268,964 new_cases 204,268 total_deaths 6,242,509 new_deaths 630 total_recovered 461,827,849 active_cases 41,198,606 serious_critical 42,510 total_cases_per_1m_population 65,334 deaths_per_1m_population 800.9 statistic_taken_at 2022-04-24 11:18:01 Country Totals country_name USA cases 82,649,779 deaths 1,018,316 region total_recovered 80,434,925 new_deaths 0 new_cases 0 serious_critical 1,465 active_cases 1,196,538 total_cases_per_1m_population 247,080 deaths_per_1m_population 3,044 total_tests 1,000,275,726 tests_per_1m_population 2,990,303 . Digital Coin Example . This example provides digital coin feedback (ie Bitcoin). It include popularity, price, symbols, etc. . A valid X-RapidAPI-Key is required. Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API.

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) . JSON data is Python type: &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above? {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You are not subscribed to this API.&#39;} . Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

            "content": "Video 1 . A program starts with an idea and is developed with a specific purpose in mind. Developers follow specific steps and follow a plan including Exploration which is a crucial part of development. Developing a program requires you to investigate a problem/purpose and reflect. Program must be designed and brainstormed, including possible requirements. Program specifications will outline all requirements. Developers create prototypes of the program or program components, and do a lot of testing. Developers refine and and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. . Video 2 . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources and include origin and author name. Programs are usually developed in teams where individuals/smaller teams work on different functional components. Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work so their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions and you can use comments in the programming to give credit. If there’s a bug or error in the program, then comments can help identify who is responsible. This is useful after a program is complete and users find additional bugs. Many times, developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others which is similar to quoting someone in a paper. Any code segments, procedures, algorithms, etc… are considered the intellectual property of the author. . Video 3 . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. Comments can be made in a programming language as a form of documentation. Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required. Programmers should document a program throughout its development this in developing and maintaining correct programs. Create a program documentation to describe overall program and list program specs. In the beginning you should list specifications. During Development keep track of progress and at the end explain your overall process. Documenting throughout the programming can improve efficiency and the programmers’ response to bugs. .
