"The CSP Manifesto"
I spent 2 ------- weeks trying to make the ------- flask run on AWS. If I could do it again i'd ---- over my group because I ended up getting no one a better grade. The only thing I have learned is that you shouldn't care about anyone but yourself. Beyond that, this class itself is a load of ---------. This introductory class is supposed to teach at most what a ------- loop is. HTML, and backend APIs are advanced beyond what this class SHOULD expect. This calss should be able to be completed by an achieved software engineer. My dad works in government software development and has no way to help me in this class. I spoke out to a student with a master's degree in software and they couldnt figure it out either. This class is 100% unbridled --------. ---- you.

Worst wishes,
Colin Mills
