## Remote Theme

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2022-09-01.png)

I found that a regular issue with remote themes is a lack of pages and other extended features. Many external links did not embed such as my socials.

## Table Usage

[Weekly Table](https://iconicshark3.github.io/ColinMills/weekly/)

## Tagging

I attempted to tag any experimantal posts as informal to clarify that they are not intended to be complete pages. I ended up using categories and that was far more successfull.

## Search

I have considered the use of the search tool by implimenting categories and choosing useful titles.
