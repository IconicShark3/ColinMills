## Table Usage

[Weekly Table](https://iconicshark3.github.io/ColinMills/weekly/)

## Tagging

I attempted to tag any experimantal posts as informal to clarify that they are not intended to be complete pages. I ended up using categories and that was far more successfull.

## Search

I have considered the use of the search tool by implimenting categories and choosing useful titles.
