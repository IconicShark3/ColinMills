## Reflection:
Computing bias is an ongoing problem in the modern technical age. Computers are advancing at incredible rates but inequality in access has led to unjust code being developed. One notable example is an ola version of HP's camera targeting system that malfunctioned if presented with a face of darker skin. Another example of computing bias is when basic programs require excessive hardware, limiting the amount of people who can use it. A great example of this is Windows 11, which requires a Trusted Platform Managment system to be in place to install.
