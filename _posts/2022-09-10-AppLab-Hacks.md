## Design
> Brainstorming
1. What does SUV stand for?
- *Sports Utility Vehicle*
- SUper Van
- Semi-Utilitarian Veteran
- Slightly Upset Volvo
2. Which unique number helps the manufacturer identify your vehicle?
- *VIN*
- License Plate
- MSRP
- Radiator
3. What part of ChrisFix's car broke during the 24 Hours of Lemons?
- *Piston Connecting Rod*
- Blinker Fluid
- Camshaft
- Piston Return Spring

## Discoveries
- Taking a project from concept to code is a lot harder than it seems on paper.
- Making code function effectively is much harder than making code work at al.

## Successes
- We found out that to make the answer checking system work we needed to stack seperate buttons for each question.
- After a few revisions and methodoligies our code ended up functioning.

## Challenges
- Coding using radio buttons is something we had never done to this point

# Create Performance Task

## Purpose and Function
The purpose of this program is to learn the basics of JavaScript through the creation of a simple quiz. The program uses basic functions and IO control to ask questions, check answers, and provide answer confirmation.

## Data Abstraction
We built this program using the includedm data table feature insode of App Lab. The table used is titled **Questions and Answers** and is used to store the questions being asked, and the answers that are used and correct.

## Managing Complexity
We made the decision to switch from hard to code traditional buttons to simple radio button selection and check.

## Procedural Abstraction
We created a function called display to show all of he questions and answers based on a single value.

## Algorithm Implementation
We implemented an algorithm to check our answers following the pressing of the check button.

## Testing
We shared our program with multiple other people and another team to get feedback to make improvements.

# Alternate App
Possibly a planner that can automatically organize assignments by due date.
