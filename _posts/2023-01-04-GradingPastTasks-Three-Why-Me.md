## Submission 1

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|Pass|The program has a clear purpose and function that are different but related.|1|
|2|No Pass|The list is insuficcient for the listed requirements.|0|
|3|No Pass|This list isn't entirely necessary and therefore is not essential.|0|
|4|No Pass|This procedure has a fundemental process and has at least one paramater.|0|
|5|No Pass|This algorithm does not include squencing, selection, and iteration.|1|
|6|Pass|The two calls go through the algorithm and make use of Different functions in the algorithm.|1|

## Submission 2

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|Pass|Adequate explanation of the functionality of the code's Input and Output. Video clearly shows funtional code and input.|1|
|2|Pass|The program used a list to abstract the data in use.|1|
|3|Pass|This is a great example of managing complexity due to the high amount of individual values.|1|
|4|Pass|The function created relates to the program's functionality and purpose. It is well explained and meets the CollegeBoard criteria.|1|
|5|Pass|I can tell just by how many loops are being used that there is definitely iteration.|1|
|6|Pass|The function took two calls and responded with appropriate responses. Both responses used different parts of the code in the function.|1|

## Submission 3

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|Pass|The purpose of this code is different from the functionality.|1|
|2|Pass|A list is used and simplifies the program enough to warrant its use.|0|
|3|No Pass|The list used does not manage gomplexity in the project|0|
|4|No Pass|This procedure meets the Collegeboard requirements and is called in the program.|0|
|5|No Pass|This code includes all three required features and meets collegeboard requirements.|0|
|6|No Pass|Both calls pass different segments of code and have the appropriate outputs. |0|

## Submission 4

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|No Pass|The programs purpose is too similar to its functionality.|1|
|2|Pass|The program makes good use of lists and it assists in managing complexity.|1|
|3|Pass|This list effectively manages complexity and has a important role in the code that couldnt easily be written any other way.|1|
|4|Pass|This procedure has a fundemental process and has at least one paramater.|1|
|5|Pass|This algorithm includes squencing, selection, and iteration.|1|
|6|Pass|The two calls go through the algorithm and make use of fifferent functions in the algorithm.|0|
