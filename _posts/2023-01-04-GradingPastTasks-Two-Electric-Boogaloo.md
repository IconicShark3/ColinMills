## Submission 1

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|No Pass|The purpose of this code is the functionality.|0|
|2|Pass|A list is used and simplifies the program enough to warrant its use.|0|
|3|Pass|The list used does sucessfully manage gomplexity in the project|0|
|4|Pass|This procedure meets the Collegeboard requirements and is called in the program.|0|
|5|Pass|This code includes all three required features and meets collegeboard requirements.|0|
|6|Pass|Both calls pass different segments of code and have the appropriate outputs. |1|

## Submission 2

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|Pass|The program has a clear purpose and function that are different but related.|1|
|2|Pass|The program makes good use of lists and it assists in managing complexity.|1|
|3|Pass|This list effectively manages complexity and has a important role in the code that couldnt easily be written any other way.|1|
|4|Pass|This procedure has a fundemental process and has at least one paramater.|1|
|5|Pass|This algorithm includes squencing, selection, and iteration.|1|
|6|Pass|The two calls go through the algorithm and make use of fifferent functions in the algorithm.|1|
