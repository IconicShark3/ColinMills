## Submission 1

|Row #|Pass / No Pass|Comments|Collegeboard|
|---|---|----|---|
|1|No Pass|Adequate explanation of the functionality of the code's Input and Output. Video clearly shows funtional code and input. No Pass because the program's purpose is its functionality.|0|
|2|No Pass|There is no data abstraction shown in the Written Response. No new data is shown to be stored in a list.|1|
|3|No Pass|There is an attempt to manage complexity. Though, there is only one use case for each item in the list, so there is no reason to have a list.|0|
|4|Pass|The function created relates to the program's functionality and purpose. It is well explained and meets the CollegeBoard criteria.|1|
|5|Pass|The student created function includes iteration and meets all other CollegeBoard criteria.|1|
|6|Pass|The function took two calls and responded with appropriate responses. Both responses used different parts of the code in the function.|1|

2 - I focused too much on the functionality of the list. This section was mostly to identify that a list was used.

|2|Pass|The program used a list to abstract the data in use.|1|
|3|Pass|This is a great example of managing complexity due to the high amount of individual values.|1|
|4|Pass|The function created relates to the program's functionality and purpose. It is well explained and meets the CollegeBoard criteria.|1|
|5|Pass|I can tell just by how many loops are being used that there is definitely iteration.|1|
|6|Pass|The function took two calls and responded with appropriate responses. Both responses used different parts of the code in the function.|1|
